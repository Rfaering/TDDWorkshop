Bowling-Scoring Basics
One game of bowling consists of 10 frames, with a minimum score of zero and a maximum of 300. 
Each frame consists of two chances to knock down ten pins.

Open Frames
If, after two shots, at least one pin is still standing, it’s called an open frame. Whereas open frames 
are taken at face value, strikes and spares can be worth more—but not less—than face value.

This is an example of a game consiting only of open frames

Frame:				1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8		9		10
Result:				3|5		7|2		7|2		0|0		3|4		5|2		2|3		3|3		5|0		2|2
Frame Score:		8		9		9		0		7		7		5		6		5		4
Running Total:		8		17		26		26		33		40		45		51		56		60

Spares
If it takes two shots to knock down all ten pins, it’s called a spare, denoted by a /.
A spare is worth 10, plus the value of your next roll.
Say you throw a spare in your first frame. Then, in your first ball of the second frame, you throw a 7. Your score for the first frame will be 17 (10+7).
The maximum score for a frame in which you get a spare is 20 (a spare followed by a strike), and the minimum is 10 (a spare followed by a gutter ball).

Frame:				1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8		9		10
Result:				5|/		7|2		6|/		0|0		3|4		3|/		0|/		3|3		6|/		2|2
Frame Score:		17		9		10		0		7		20		13		6		12		4
Running Total:		17		26		36		36		43		63		76		84		96		100

Strike
Knocking down all ten pins on your first ball is called a strike, denoted by an X on the score sheet. 
A strike is worth 10, plus the value of your next two rolls.
At minimum, your score for a frame in which you throw a strike will be 10 (10+0+0). 
At best, your next two shots will be strikes, and the frame will be worth 30 (10+10+10).
Say you throw a strike in the first frame. Technically, you don't have a score yet. 
You need to throw two more balls to figure out your total score for the frame. 
In the second frame, you throw a 6 on your first ball and a 2 on your second ball. Your score for the first frame will be 18 (10+6+2) and 8 for your second frame.

Frame:				1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8		9		10
Result:				x		7|2		x		0/0		x		0|/		x		x		x		2|2
Frame Score:		19		9		10		0		20		20		30		22		14		4
Running Total:		19		28		38		38		58		68		98		120		134		138

The Tenth Frame
In the sample score, three shots were thrown in the tenth frame. This is because of the bonuses awarded for strikes and spares. 
If you throw a strike on your first ball in the tenth frame, you need two more shots to determine the total value of the strike.
If you throw a spare on your first two balls in the tenth frame, you need one more shot to determine the total value of the spare. This is called a fill ball.
If you throw an open frame in the tenth frame, you won't get a third shot. The only reason the third shot exists is to determine the full value of a strike or spare.

Examples of the 10th frame
Frame:				10			10			10
Result:				2|2			2|/|2		x|x|x
Frame Score:		4			12			30

If you have a game where you score 12 strikes in a row it is called a perfect game and your score is 300.
If you have a game where you score 11 strikes in a row and then knock down 9 pins on your last turn you get a score of 299 and will properly not be very happy.
